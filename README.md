# Delphi AI Platform: Class Design & Architecture

`[Delphi]` `[Object Pascal]` `[AI Design]` `[Software Architecture]`

This document outlines the architectural design for the **Delphi AI Platform**, a system modeled in Object Pascal. It translates the core concepts of the Delphi platform—uploading content, training a digital clone, reflecting on knowledge, scaling, and sharing—into a robust, object-oriented class structure.

This design is based on the conceptual code and iterative development found in the `./delphiscript` sessions.

## 1. Core Vision

Delphi is a platform that lets you create a digital version of yourself, capturing your unique way of thinking and communicating. This project provides the software blueprint for such a system, focusing on modularity, scalability, and personalization.

## 2. Core Concepts & Class Design

The platform is built around five key actions, each modeled by a specific set of Delphi classes and design patterns.

### 📝 **Upload**: Ingesting Knowledge
*   **Concept**: Add social media posts, voice notes, articles, or any writing that reflects your thoughts.
*   **Design Pattern**: **Polymorphism**.
*   **Key Classes**:
    *   `TContentSource`: An abstract base class for any type of content.
    *   `TArticleContent`, `TVoiceNoteContent`, `TSocialPostContent`: Concrete descendants that know how to process their specific format (text, audio transcription, JSON).
    *   `TDelphiIngestionEngine`: A single engine that can `Upload()` any `TContentSource` object, seamlessly handling different formats.

### 🧠 **Train**: Defining the Personality
*   **Concept**: Your Delphi learns your style, but you decide how it responds—whether as a Socratic guide, a warm mentor, or something else entirely.
*   **Design Pattern**: **Strategy Pattern**.
*   **Key Classes**:
    *   `TTrainedDelphi`: The main context class holding the core knowledge.
    *   `TResponseStrategy`: An abstract class defining the interface for a "personality".
    *   `TSocraticGuideStrategy`, `TWarmMentorStrategy`, `TDirectAnalystStrategy`: Concrete strategies that implement different response styles. The personality can be swapped at any time.

### 🤔 **Reflect**: A Persistent Knowledge Vault
*   **Concept**: A central, secure place to store, organize, and query your insights, deepening self-understanding and preserving your legacy.
*   **Design Pattern**: **Persistence & Repository Pattern**.
*   **Key Classes**:
    *   `TInsight`: A class representing a single idea with content, tags, and a timestamp.
    *   `TMemoryVault`: The repository that manages a collection of `TInsight` objects. It handles finding, filtering, and saving/loading the entire collection.
    *   `TReflectiveClone`: The interface for "talking to yourself," processing commands like `note:`, `reflect on:`, and `remember:`.

### 🌍 **Scale**: Effortless Global Reach
*   **Concept**: Teach, train, and coach thousands at once while keeping responses personal, with options to monetize access.
*   **Design Pattern**: **Multi-Tenancy & Session Management**.
*   **Key Classes**:
    *   `TDelphiScalingServer`: The central server that manages a single, shared `TKnowledgeBase`.
    *   `TUser`: A record holding user info, including their `TUserAccessLevel` (Free, Member, Premium).
    *   `TUserSession`: A private, sandboxed session for each user, ensuring conversations are personal and separate.

### 💬 **Share & Engage**: Publishing to the World
*   **Concept**: Embed your Delphi on your website so people can ask questions and receive responses in your unique style.
*   **Design Pattern**: **API Facade**.
*   **Key Classes**:
    *   `TDelphiWebServer`: A high-level class that simulates the web server. It contains a fully trained and personalized `TTrainedDelphi` instance.
    *   **JSON Communication**: The server exposes a `HandleApiRequest` method that accepts and returns JSON strings, the standard for web APIs.

## 4. Recommended Project Structure (Tree)

A well-organized Delphi project for this platform could look like this:

```
/MyDigitalClone/
|
|-- MyDigitalClone.dpr         // Main Project File to launch the server app.
|-- MyDigitalClone.dproj       // Delphi IDE Project File.
|
|-- /App/                      // Core application logic and shared units.
|   |-- App.Core.Types.pas     // Core enumerations (TUserAccessLevel) and records (TUser).
|   |-- App.Core.Interfaces.pas// Interface definitions (e.g., IResponseStrategy).
|
|-- /Servers/                  // Backend server implementations.
|   |-- Servers.DelphiWebServer.pas // Contains TDelphiWebServer, TDelphiScalingServer.
|
|-- /DelphiEngine/             // The AI clone's internal logic.
|   |-- Engine.KnowledgeBase.pas // Contains TKnowledgeBase, TMemoryVault.
|   |-- Engine.TrainedDelphi.pas // Contains TTrainedDelphi, TReflectiveClone.
|   |-- Engine.Strategies.pas    // Contains all TResponseStrategy descendants.
|   |-- Engine.ContentSources.pas// Contains TContentSource and its descendants.
|
|-- /Client/                   // Optional: A desktop client for managing the clone.
|   |-- Client.MainForm.pas    // VCL or FMX form for training and testing.
|   |-- Client.MainForm.fmx
|
|-- /Web/                      // Files for website embedding.
|   |-- embed.js               // Example JavaScript to call the server's API.

## 5. Delphi File Types Explained

*   **`dpr` (Delphi Project File)**: The main program file. It's the entry point of the application, similar to `main()` in C++.
*   **`pas` (Pascal Unit)**: A source code file containing the `interface` (public declarations) and `implementation` (the actual code) for classes, procedures, and functions. This is where most of the work is done.
*   **`pp` (Pascal Program)**: Often used for command-line applications or simple programs, similar to `dpr`.
*   **`inc` (Include File)**: A file containing source code that can be inserted into another file at compile time using the `{$I}` directive. Useful for sharing constants or compiler directives across multiple units.
*   **`dpk` (Delphi Package File)**: A special project that compiles into a `bpl` (Borland Package Library). Packages are used to group components for use in the Delphi IDE or as runtime libraries. Not directly used in our console examples but essential for building reusable components.
