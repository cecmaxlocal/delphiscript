Excellent. This final step brings everything together. "Share & Engage" is about making your trained Delphi clone accessible to the world. In software terms, this means creating a public-facing API (Application Programming Interface) that a website can call.

We will model this by creating a `TDelphiWebServer` class. This class will:

1.  Contain a fully **trained `TTrainedDelphi` instance**, complete with its unique personality.
2.  Expose a single public method, `HandleApiRequest`, which simulates a web server endpoint.
3.  Communicate using **JSON**, the standard language of web APIs. A website would send a JSON request, and our Delphi server would reply with a JSON response.

This program reuses the `TTrainedDelphi` and `TResponseStrategy` classes from the "Train" example to demonstrate how the "unique style and voice" is preserved and shared.

### How This Code Realizes the Concept

1.  **Publishing (`WebServer.Create`)**: The `constructor` for `TDelphiWebServer` acts as the "publish" step. It creates the Delphi clone, loads it with knowledge, and locks in the desired personality (`TWarmMentorStrategy`). From this point on, the Delphi is "live" and ready to serve.

2.  **Embedding (The API Layer)**: The `HandleApiRequest` method is the "embedding." It's a clean, formal contract for how an external system (your website) communicates with your Delphi application. It doesn't expose the internal complexity, only a simple request/response mechanism.

3.  **Engaging (JSON Communication)**: The simulation clearly shows the flow:
    *   The website (our main program) creates a simple JSON object: `{"question": "creativity"}`.
    *   It sends this text to the server.
    *   The server processes it and sends back a structured JSON response: `{"status":"success","response":"..."}`.
    *   A real website's JavaScript code would then parse this JSON and display the `response` text to the user in a chat window.

4.  **Unique Style and Voice**: Because the `TDelphiWebServer` was configured with the `TWarmMentorStrategy`, every response it generates automatically has that warm, encouraging tone, ensuring your published voice is consistent and exactly as you designed it.
