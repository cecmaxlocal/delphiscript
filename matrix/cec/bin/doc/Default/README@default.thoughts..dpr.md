**Refining Upload Logic**

I'm now focusing on the core action: uploading. I'm breaking it down to its fundamental components.  There's a defined source and a destination for the content. The challenge now lies in handling different content types—social media posts, voice notes, articles, etc.—to build the Delphi code efficiently.


**Designing Content Ingestion**

I'm now thinking about the internal class structure to best manage various content types. It seems clear that polymorphism is the best approach to handle the disparate content source types. I'm leaning toward a `TContentSource` base class with subclasses for text, audio, and social media posts, each with its own specific processing logic. The `IngestionEngine` will then iterate and process these different source types. This method appears to allow the most flexibility in the long run.


**Conceptualizing Text Extraction**

I'm now diving into the implementation of `ExtractText` methods for each content type. While the base class will offer the fundamental structure, I'm finding that the specifics of text extraction significantly vary. The article content will be straightforward, but the voice note content presents an interesting challenge. I'll need a placeholder for the speech-to-text functionality, perhaps a simulated transcription.  I'm also considering how to structure the return of extracted text; a simple string might suffice, but perhaps a structured text object would offer greater flexibility in future processing steps.


**Formulating Ingestion Architecture**

I've just finalized the class structure for content ingestion. We'll have a `TContentSource` base class with virtual `ExtractText` and `ContentType` properties. Descendant classes like `TArticleContent`, `TVoiceNoteContent`, and `TSocialPostContent` will inherit and implement their specific extraction logic. The `TDelphiIngestionEngine` will then process `TContentSource` objects using polymorphism, simplifying the upload procedure significantly. I'll test this design shortly.


**Developing Class Structures**

I'm now implementing the classes and their inheritance hierarchy. I've designed the base `TContentSource` class, with the `SourcePath` property, and I'm developing the descendant classes. `TArticleContent` seems straightforward. `TVoiceNoteContent` will return a placeholder, while `TSocialPostContent` will need to extract text from JSON. The key here is the `ExtractText` method for each. I'm focusing on simplicity and clarity.


**Developing `Upload` Method**

The core focus is now on the `Upload` method within the `IngestionEngine`. This method will handle diverse content using the `ExtractText` method of the polymorphic `TContentSource` class. I'm aiming for a straightforward, single-purpose method, simply accepting a `TContentSource` instance and storing the extracted text. This will streamline the upload process and promote code reusability.


**Developing the Upload Procedure**

I'm presently building out the Upload method within the IngestionEngine. This is the central piece, accepting `TContentSource` instances. It will invoke the ExtractText method, enabling polymorphic handling of different content types. The aim is a straightforward, clean method.


**Developing the Ingestion Engine**

I'm now in the final phases of constructing the ingestion engine. It will use a `TStringList` internally to store the extracted text from the diverse content. The architecture will allow the ingestion engine to process different content types polymorphically, as the `Upload` method only requires a `TContentSource` instance. This design keeps the system flexible, testable, and maintainable.


**Finalizing Upload Implementation**

I'm completing the Upload method within the Delphi IngestionEngine. This is the last bit. It now handles all source content types polymorphically via the ExtractText method. The method accepts and ingests `TContentSource` instances, storing the extracted text to a internal `TStringList`. I've made sure to free all objects in the `try-finally` block to prevent any memory leaks. It's ready for final testing!
